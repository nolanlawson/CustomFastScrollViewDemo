Deprecation Notice
==========

This project has been deprecated in favor of the [SuperSaiyanScrollView](http://nolanlawson.com/2013/11/30/introducing-the-supersaiyanscollview-super-fast-sectioned-lists-for-android/), which works as a standalone library project and has an updated look for Holo devices.

Original documentation follows.

CustomFastScrollView Demo
=========================

Demo of an Android app showing a CustomFastScrollView with a larger window size than in the default FastScrollView.

In this example app, we have a list of countries sorted by their continent.  It is also possible to change the sorting by using the buttons at the bottom.
